# Image-Processing
Java GUI application serving as showcase for algorithms that I studied in Graphical Computing class.

## About

This is a JAVA program that was made out of the many algorithms that I had to implement for my Graphical Computing class assignments. Since I loved that class so much, I got excited and turned out making this paint-alike GUI for those algorithms.

I hope this repository can help others with their studies :)

## Be Aware!

Notice that the approach used in this application is very memory consuming in therms of loading and processing images, and some algorithms are not optimized.
